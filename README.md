Duck Hunt
========

<h3><b>Description</h3></b>
Re-creating the popular Nintendo NES game Duck Hunt, using C++ and the SDL API, will give me a lot of practice with animation, collision detection etc. Second project with SDL Game development, using tutorials at <a href = "http://www.lazyfoo.net">Lazy Foo</a> for reference.

Note: So far, I have implemented a basic version of the game (with only one level, 10 ducks etc). I plan to update it whenever I get time, eventually it will match the actual implementation, however the process will not be very quick as school will take priority.

<h3><b>Current Implementation</h3></b>
According to the current implementation of the project, which is still in development, there are a total 10 ducks, all of which are black coloured ducks and all which travel at the same speed. At the end of the 10 ducks, the game will automatically quit. Furthermore, the scoring system has not been implemented yet, and neither has the related UI been implemented. 
<br><br>
The duck will fly around for approximately 5 seconds, and if it has not been killed by then, it will fly away. Alternatively, if the user shoots a total of 3 times and misses, the duck will also fly away. All the related animations with the duck as well as the hunting dog are already present.

<h3><b>Rules and Regulations</h3></b>
The rules and the way in which the game is supposed to play can be read <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt">here</a>.
